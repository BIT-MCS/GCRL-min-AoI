Graph Convolutional Reinforcement Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9796732/)", published in IEEE INFOCOM 2022.

## :page_facing_up: Description
Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) with smart devices has become an appealing paradigm for urban sensing.With the development of 5G-and-beyond technologies, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become possible for real-time applications, including wireless coverage, search and even disaster response. In this paper, we consider to use a group of UAVs as aerial base stations (BSs) to move around and collect data from multiple MCS users, forming a UAV crowdsensing campaign (UCS). Our goal is to maximize the collected data, geographical coverage whiling minimizing the age-of-information (AoI) of all mobile users simultaneously, with efficient use of constrained energy reserve. We propose a model-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework called ”GCRL-min(AoI)”, which mainly consists of a novel model-based Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) structure based on state-of-the- art approach MCTS (AlphaZero). We further improve it by adding a spatial UAV-user correlation extraction mechanism by a relational graph convolutional network (RGCN), and a next state prediction module to reduce the dependance of experience data. Extensive results and trajectory visualization on three real human mobility datasets in Purdue University, KAIST and NCSU show that GCRL-min(AoI) consistently outperforms five
baselines, when varying different number of UAVs and maximum coupling loss in terms of four metrics.
